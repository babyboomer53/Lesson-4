# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (CSE-41321)
## UCSD Extension â€“ Summer 2021 (157162)
### Homework Assignment #4
#### Introduction
The purpose of this exercises is to implement an algorithm that uses stacks to add whole numbers of any size.

The largest number that Java can store is around 9.23 quintillion (9,223,372,036,854,775,807 to be exact). Integers of
this magnitude are provided for by Java's primitive data type called "long." Manipulating anything larger will 
require some sleight of hand.
